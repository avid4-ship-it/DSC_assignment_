Cell 1: Finding & Showing the Groups
This part runs the main group-finding process described above. It prints out how the "group score" improves with each successful split.
Finally, it shows three pictures of the network:
Start: The network before any splits (one big group).
Middle: The network part-way through the process.
End: The final groups the code discovered.
Cell 2: Checking How Nodes Change
This cell makes a bunch of plots (one for every person in the Karate Club).
It tracks how "important" each person is at every step of the splitting process. This shows how someone's role can change as their local "neighborhood" gets smaller and more defined
